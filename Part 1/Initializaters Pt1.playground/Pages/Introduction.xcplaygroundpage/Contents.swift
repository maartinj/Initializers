 # Swift Initializers Part 1

 * Created by [Stewart Lynch](https://twitter.com/StewartLynch) â€“ [CreaTECH Solutions](https://www.createchsol.com.com)
 * Last update: March 11, 2020

 This playground is designed to help you understand the initialization process for classes and structs.

 If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@StewartLynch](https://twitter.com/StewartLynch) or email <slynch@createchsol.com>.

 - important: Classes and structures must set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties cannot be left in an indeterminate state.
